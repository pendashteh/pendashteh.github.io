# Repositories

There are some useful repositories in the mix. Here's a curated list for his own benefit.

## git wip
https://github.com/chipshell/git-wip
Made with claude (or was it chat?). Something Alexar uses instead of standard git.
It makes standard git commands a stroke of a letter:
l for log
s for status
d for diff
like a git console. if you press 'w' it amends al changes to existing WIP commit. As in work in progress.
